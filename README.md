This is a hodgepodge collection of utilities use by several of our applications.

Originally it was intended for Seam/Jpa projects, but it is used for other kinds, as well.

At some point, this will be split into smaller util projects with much more focused dependency-lists.

Classes added to this project should have good unit tests and good javadocs.  Javadocs are more important
here than they are in other application projects.
